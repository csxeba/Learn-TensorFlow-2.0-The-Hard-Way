# Learn TF2 The Hard Way...

Working examples of Deep Learning algorithms implemented with TensorFlow 2.

A suggested order of examination/walkthrough would be the follwing:

1) Supervised: `classify_mnist.py`
2) Generative: `fit_vae.py`
3) Generative: `fit_gan.py`
4) Reinforcement: `policy_gradient.py`
5) Reinforcement: `deep_q_network.py`
